# Morris Dance Tunes

The purpose here is to have a repo of tunes I can maintain locally on my laptop. This will allow me to update and add tunes and share them via my repo. 

The starting point will be the source files from [Lionel Bacon's "Handbook of Morris Dances"](http://www.themorrisring.org/music/handbook-morris-dances) as those have become the canonical versions of the tunes. But I will also notate local variations to the traditional tunes and add tunes for composed dances. 

Iâ€™m updating all the abc files, including those derived from Bacon, to comply with [abc standard v2.1](http://abcnotation.com/wiki/abc:standard:v2.1).
